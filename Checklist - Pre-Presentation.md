| 2 |   | Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them|
| 3 | √ | Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions|
| 4 |   | The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)|
| 5 |   | The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)|
| 6 |   | Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary|
| 7 |   | The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean? |

### Development Requirements

| Step | Status | Requirement |
| :---: | :---: | :--- 
| 1 |   | Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
| 2 |   | Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
| 3 |   | Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, have at least 2  vizualizations per ”question” you ask of your data)
| 4 |   | Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
| 5 |   | (Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. 
| 6 |   | Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. 
| 7 |   | Include a heading for each question you asked of your data 
| 8 |   | Include a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.

**Scott:** Looks like we need min of 3 or max of 4 questions. We're asked for 6-8 visualizations, and to "have at least 2 per question".
