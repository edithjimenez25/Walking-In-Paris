# Project Description/Outline:
Identify the attributes that make for a successful Airbnb property/host in Hawaii. 

Examples from other teams:
1. Gather information regarding restaurant health inspection score and the neighborhood they reside in.
2. People commonly argue what city’s drivers are the worst in bad weather. We want to use objective datasets to explore these claims. We plan to combine accident data from selected cities with historical weather data to investigate which city’s drivers drive the worst in bad weather (e.g., rain). We plan to analyze certain aspects such as precipitation data by day, etc. and compare them to accident data to infer any connections.
3. Is the health outcome of people living in rural counties different from those in urban counties in Texas?
4. Have you ever wondered if the winning teams in the World Cup have something in common? Us too! We’re going to be looking a factor of weather. We will try to find a relationship between weather & temperature and how successful a team has been in the World Cup.
5. Compare happiness of U.S. cities to a.) Financial health (average income), and b.) availability of recreation activity (parks, lakes, rivers, trails, gyms, etc.)

### Hypothesis
The number of properties rented out by a host has no impact on rating

Candidates:

Examples from other teams:
1. Urban counties have a higher life expectancy on average than Rural counties in Texas
2. Is overall happiness of the 10 happiest U.S. cities more driven by financial health or recreational activity?
3. If a restaurant has a poor health inspection score they will also have a low rating on yelp or google.
  * >90 = Good rating
  * 86-90 = Adequate
  * 71-85 = Needs improvement
  * <=70 = Poor
4. For the top 10 cities by population, cities with typically drier weather (as determined by average annual precipitation) will see a larger percentage change in fatal accident rates on rainy days than the percentage change in rates observed for typically wetter cities.
5. The USA has the highest average rating of all wines

### Null Hypothesis
1. Neighborhood has no impact on overall rating 
None of the factors we are analyzing (neighborhood, number of listings per host, room type, price, keywords in description, how long the host has been hosting, and certain amenities) have an impact on the overall rating.

Examples from other teams:
1. If a restaurant has a poor health inspection score they will not also have a low rating on yelp or google.

### Research Questions to Answer
From the requirements: "Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them"
(to do - these are from original readme.md)
1. Is there a relationship between "age of property" and ratings per month? price?
2. Is there a relationship between "how many properties someone has" and ratings?
3. Is there a relationship between number of bedrooms and bookings per month?
4. Is there a relationship between neighborhoods and bookings per month?
5. Where should we go looking (neighborhood, type of place) for the best value at the best price?
6. Are there are any trigger words in the name that relate to higher bookings?
7. Is there a relationship between price and bookings?

Scott:
1. Of the six dimensions for ratings (Accuracy, Cleanliness, Checkin, Communication, Location, Value), is one more important than the rest? Example: if a property is a low Cleanliness score, would it be more likely that all other scores are also lower on average?

Examples from other teams:
1. Do urban counties have a higher life expectancy than rural counties?
2. What health behavior factors correlate with life expectancy?
3. What clinical care factors correlate with life expectancy?
4. What social and economic factors correlate with life expectancy?
5. What physical environment factors correlate with life expectancy?
6. What are the Top 5 and Bottom 5 counties measured by life expectancy?
7. Heat map of Texas showing life expectancy

1. Does a country's weather correlate to success? I.e. Do warm weather countries tend to fare better than countries with weather extremes (heat and cold)? People’ ability to play soccer outside, practice and improve country’ playing level in general

1. Across all selected cities, how many more accidents occur in bad weather of various types, versus in good weather?
2. How do the individual cities compare with each other during different weather conditions?
3. Can cities be grouped into “used to the rain” and “not used to the rain” categories?

1. Top 10 wineries based on the points scale?
2. Top 10 bottles by price?
3. Comparison of country of origin vs rating
4. Countries by winery (top 10 shown in our bar graph)
5. Winery  by location (heat map)
6. Comparison by price and rating.
7. Show USA regions with wineries by percentage (pie chart)

### Implications of Our Data Analysis
(to do)

Examples from other teams:
1. Our data proves our hypothesis to be correct.


### Data Sources
1. http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html # Hawaii data set named "listings.csv"
2. (to do - add more detail points)


Examples from other teams: 
1. Financial: demographic income data from government census data. Recreation: google maps search results for recreation activity listed above
2. FIFA World cup soccer data https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup. Countries weather data https://openweathermap.org/api
